## Appendix 3: Effect of protection types

To account for differences in protected area types, RZ performed random-intercept and random-slope models for each habitat type and soil biodiversity and functioning attribute. Protection status was considered as a factor (random intercept) and continuous variable (random slope) respectively. Protected areas are classified into one of seven IUCN categories [@unep-wcmc2021; @dudley2008]. The Protected Area dataset contains three additional categories (not reported, not assigned and not applicable) that were included. Sampling sites outside of any protected area were classified as "unprotected". Habitat type was included in regional and continental models as both a fixed effect and random factor. Model formulas were `attribute ~ protection status + habitat type + (1 | habitat type)` for the random-intercept model and `attribute ~ protection status * habitat type + (protection status | habitat type)` for the random-slope model. It is important to note that sample size for some protection types is rather low and results for the random-intercept and random-slope model are thus less meaningful than effect size estimates for protected-unprotected pairs. For both random-intercept and random-slope models, RZ run 10,000 iterations, including 2,000 warm-up iterations, and 4 chains with the R package brms [@brms]. Priors of soil biodiversity and functioning attributes were by default chosen to be non or very weakly informative so that their influence on the results will be negligible and you usually don't have to worry about them. To extract the effect of protection level, RZ used the emtrends and emmeans function of the emmeans package [@emmeans], which calculates the estimated marginal means of the linear trends and provides credible intervals (i.e., highest posterior density interval, HPDI; probability: 95%) of the posterior distributions. All points within that interval have a higher probability density than the points outside the interval. In addition, RZ extracted posterior samples of slope estimates with the modelr [@modelr] and tidybayes [@tidybayes] package for visualization using the ggdist pa

In comparison to the effect size estimation, we did not build pairs of protected and unprotected sites but rather included all data available (except for bacteria, see Appendix 4). Final datasets included `r nrow(clean_glob)` sites at global scale (protected=`r table(clean_glob$PA)[2]` \| unprotected=`r table(clean_glob$PA)[1]`), `r nrow(clean_cont)` sites at continental scale (`r table(clean_cont$PA)[2]` \| `r table(clean_cont$PA)[1]`), and `r nrow(clean_regi)` sites at regional scale (`r table(clean_regi$PA)[2]` \| `r table(clean_regi$PA)[1]`). It is important to note that the inclusion of more sampling sites in the random-intercept and random-slope models compared to the effect size calculations lead to a broader spatial distribution of points, especially at continental scale (Appendix Figure 3.1).

The analysis of protected area types revealed mixed patterns, but attributes of soil biodiversity and functioning were mostly similar across protection levels and did not differ in or across protected and unprotected sites (e.g. 95% CI of intercept and slope estimates largely overlapping with each other and 0 respectively). In the random-slope models, we found a lower number of tested trends to be significant (`r n_slope_significant` out of `r n_slope_total`) compared with the effect size estimation (`r n_significant` out of `r n_total`; Appendix Figure 3.2), but biodiversity and functioning attributes or habitat types or scales slightly differed for them and did not coincide. Random slopes were significant mostly at regional scale (n = 9), for protected woodlands (6) and for richness (6), but only once for their combination (Appendix Figure 3.2, Appendix Table 3.1 and 3.2), namely a positive effect on richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi in regional woodlands. Most regional effects were in grasslands and croplands (4 each), and the significant effects at continental scale only in woodlands (5) with none of them on functions. In global drylands, we did not find a single slope being significantly different from 0, even though we found a couple of significant effect size estimates. This difference seemed to result from large HPD intervals of slope estimates, that may be driven by soil biodiversity and functioning attribute values of unprotected areas being close to the average of total protected areas (see figures of random-intercept models below). Because of higher and lower values of protected sites compared to unprotected ones, slope estimates can be negative and positive and thereby mutually extinguish across protection levels.

#| label: Figure 3.2

### Detailed description of differences to effect size estimates

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

n_slope_sign_group_fun <- slope_stats %>% 
  filter(significance!="ns" & !is.na(significance)) %>% 
  filter(Group_function == "Function") %>% 
  count() %>%
  pull(n)

n_slope_sign_group_div <- slope_stats %>% 
  filter(significance!="ns" & !is.na(significance)) %>% 
  filter(Group_function != "Function") %>% 
  count() %>%
  pull(n)

```

Overall, we can draw similar conclusions from random-slope model and effect size estimates for soil biodiversity and functioning attributes, as both did not show consistent patterns across habitat types, scales, or attributes. In contrast to the effect sizes, we found more significant trends for biodiversity (`r n_slope_sign_group_div` out of `r nrow(slope_stats %>% filter(Group_function == "Function"))` = `r round(n_slope_sign_group_div / (nrow(slope_stats %>% filter(Group_function == "Function"))), 3) * 100`%) than for functioning attributes (`r n_slope_sign_group_fun` out of `r nrow(slope_stats %>% filter(Group_function != "Function"))` = `r round(n_slope_sign_group_fun / (nrow(slope_stats %>% filter(Group_function != "Function"))), 3) * 100`%). However, soil carbon was still not affected by protection. The positive effect of protection on decomposition in regional grasslands and the negative effect on soil stability in regional croplands were the only 2 slope estimates being significantly different from 0; both aligned with the results from the effect size estimates. In contrast to the effect sizes, we did not find significant effects of protection on nutrient cycling and pathogen control in the random-slope models.

```

Organism diversity showed no consistent trends and the ones that were significant also in the effect size analysis were mostly different. Bacterial richness trends were complementary to effect size estimates, as we found positive trends in continental woodlands for bacterial richness (`r slope_details$bact_richness`) in contrast to the negative effect size estimates at regional and global scale (Appendix Figure 3.2). Bacterial Shannon index showed similar (`r slope_details$bact_shannon_cont`) and dissimilarity exactly opposing pattern (`r slope_details$bact_dissimilarity_cont`), but slope estimates were smaller than for richness. In addition, we found a negative effect of bacterial Shannon index in regional grasslands (`r slope_details$bact_shannon_regi`) that aligned with the significantly negative effect size estimate. Only in the random-slope model, we found fungal dissimilarity to be lower in continental protected woodlands, which contrasted findings of the effect size estimates, that were positive for continental grasslands and global drylands. Looking at richness of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi individually, trends for AM and EM fungi richness did align with some results from effect size estimates: In regional grasslands, AM fungi richness decreased across the protection levels, while EM fungi increased. The remaining significant effects on AM and EM fungi found in effect size estimates could not be detected in the random-slope model (e.g. the lower richness at global scale). Invertebrate diversity showed no significant trend along the protection levels, also not the one found at global scale for effect sizes. Similarly, decomposer richness trends in random-slope models were not significantly different from 0. However, we found the same pattern for nematode richness in effect size and slope estimates in regional croplands but not in global drylands. Similarly, protists showed only one positive trend in continental woodlands, that was also found in effect sizes, but not in regional grasslands.

Results for the predicted intercepts and slopes per spatial scale and habitat type can be found in Appendix Figure 3.3 to 3.8. It is again important to note that sample size for some protection types is rather low and results especially for the random-intercept but also random-slope model are less meaningful than effect size estimates for protected-unprotected pairs.

At global scale, the dataset from [@maestre2015; @maestre2022] contained `r nrow(clean_bact)` sites with complete bacteria diversity data (hereafter bacteria-complete) but only `r nrow(clean_glob)` sites with complete biodiversity data of all taxonomic groups investigated (hereafter all-complete). We therefore decided to run two analyses for bacteria: one with all `r nrow(clean_bact)` sites and one with only `r nrow(clean_glob)` sites. We did not keep the sites with missing data in the complete dataset (`r nrow(clean_glob)` sites), as we wanted to simplify the coding steps by first sub-setting the data (i.e. complete rows only) and then building the pairs for further analysis. This way, we were also comparing the same sites for different biodiversity and functioning attributes measures instead of having results from different pairs for each measure.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("docs", "Appendix_maps_globalBacteria.png"))

```

Similarly to the main analysis, we excluded sites with pairing possibilities below 10 at global scale. We limited the number of sites that should be paired to the minimum number of protected sites from the all-complete dataset for better comparability, that is 39 at global scale. Final sampling sites considered in the effect size analysis were `r nrow(clean_d_bact)` for the bacteria-complete dataset (protected=`r table(clean_d_bact$PA)[2]` \| unprotected=`r table(clean_d_bact$PA)[1]`) and `r nrow(clean_d_glob)` for the all-complete dataset (`r table(clean_d_glob$PA)[2]` \| `r table(clean_d_glob$PA)[1]`). In the random-intercept and random-slope model, final sampling sites considered were `r nrow(clean_bact)` for the bacteria-complete dataset (protected=`r table(clean_bact$PA)[2]` \| unprotected=`r table(clean_bact$PA)[1]`) and `r nrow(clean_glob)` for the all-complete dataset (`r table(clean_glob$PA)[2]` \| `r table(clean_glob$PA)[1]`). Remarkable changes in the geographical distribution of sampling sites used in the effect size analysis are added sites that are missing in the all-complete dataset around the Mediterranean Sea, in Australia, and in North and South America (Appendix Figure 4.1). Note that sites are different in the effect size estimation map because of the different possible set of pairs. Regarding protected area categories, the bacteria-complete dataset contained 2 sites in category Ib and VI each as well as 1 site in category Ia, among others; these categories were not present in the all-complete dataset. Results of the random-slope model have therefore to be compared with caution, as trends may result from the addition of levels in the independent variable.

### Effect sizes

During randomized pairing, protected sites were more repeatedly used in the all-complete rather than in the bacteria-complete dataset, which can partly be explained by the lower number of total sites investigated of the all-complete dataset. On average, each protected and unprotected site of the bacteria-complete dataset was used in 812 (SD=12, min=782, max=837) and 429 (SD=299, min=1, max=821) of the 1000 randomized pairings, respectively. In comparison, for the all-complete dataset, all 39 protected sites were used in all of the 1000 randomized pairings, and unprotected sites were used 424 times on average in the 1000 randomized pairings (SD=366, min=1, max=979).

In contrast to the patterns from the all-complete dataset, we found a positive effect of protection on bacterial richness and Shannon index in the bacteria-complete dataset, while effect size for dissimilarity was not significantly different from 0 (Appendix Table 4.1); the all-complete dataset showed the exact opposite pattern with less diverse and similar bacteria communities in protected areas. Higher richness and Shannon index in protected areas in the bacteria-complete dataset are exactly opposite to the pattern we found at regional scale, indicating again that effects are not consistent across scales.

### Random-intercept model

Random-intercept models did not differ for the bacteria-complete and all-complete dataset regarding the protected area categories that are present in both (Appendix Table 4.2; Appendix Figure 4.2). In addition to the results of the all-complete dataset described in the main text and Appendix 2-3, we found similarly low bacterial richness and Shannon index as well as similarly high dissimilarity for protected sites of category Ib and VI, that align with richness trends for sites labelled as *Not Assigned* and otherwise did not differ from attribute values in other IUCN categories.

```

### Random-slope model

Using the bacteria-complete dataset resulted in similar patterns for all slope estimates of bacterial diversity (Appendix Figure 4.2; Appendix Table 4.3). We found no significant slopes for bacterial diversity and dissimilarity, similar to the all-complete dataset.

Results for the all-complete (left) and bacteria-complete dataset (right) from the random-intercept (left panel, pointrange plot) and random-slope model (right panel, line plot). Pointrange plots: Results from the random-intercept model. Bars represent 66% and 95% quantile (percentage) intervals, vertical bars indicate medians of the estimated group means. Dark gray rectangles represent unprotected sites, light gray areas represent sites that are protected but cannot be grouped into one of the 7 IUCN protection categories (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI). Line plots: Results from the random-slope model. Gray shades represent highest posterior density intervals (HPDI) with probability being 50%, 80% and 95%, respectively. Colored lines indicate medians of the estimated group means for each habitat type. Protection level 1 to 10 represent IUCN categories \"Not Applicable\",  \"Not Assigned\", \"Not Reported\", VI, V, IV, III, II, Ib and Ia.
